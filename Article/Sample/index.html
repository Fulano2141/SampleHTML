            Java is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based, object-oriented[15] (although not a pure
            object-oriented language, as it contains primitive types[16][unreliable source?]), and designed to have as
            few implementation dependencies as
            possible. It is intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[17] meaning that
            compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.[18] Java
            applications are typically
            compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer
            architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either
            of them. As of 2019, Java
            was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub,[19][20] particularly for
            client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.[21]
