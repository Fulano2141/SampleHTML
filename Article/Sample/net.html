            .NET Framework (pronounced as "dot net") is a software framework developed by Microsoft that runs primarily
            on Microsoft Windows. It includes a large class library named as Framework Class Library (FCL) and provides
            language interoperability (each language
            can use code written in other languages) across several programming languages. Programs written for .NET
            Framework execute in a software environment (in contrast to a hardware environment) named the Common
            Language Runtime (CLR). The CLR is
            an application virtual machine that provides services such as security, memory management, and exception
            handling. As such, computer code written using .NET Framework is called "managed code". FCL and CLR together
            constitute the .NET Framework.
